   2. Scope Management: Clearly defining the project scope at the outset and managing scope creep (unexpected changes or additions to the project) ensures that new features don't push the project over budget.
   3. Risk Management: Identify potential cost-related risks early, such as unexpected changes in technology, staffing needs, or third-party vendor fees, and build contingencies into the budget to account for these risks
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall Methodology: A linear, sequential approach where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next. It is structured, with clear requirements and deadlines defined from the start while AgBetter Quality Assuranceile Methodology: An iterative, flexible approach that breaks the project into small, manageable increments (called sprints), allowing for continuous feedback, adaptation, and revisions throughout the development cycle
Advantages of Waterfall
1. Clear Structure and Documentation
2. Predictability
3. Ideal for Smaller Projects where requirements are clear, static, and unlikely to change
Disadvantages of Waterfall
1. Inflexibility to Changes
2. Risk of Misalignment with Client Expectations
3. Delayed Testing
Advantages of Agile
1. Flexibility and Adaptability
2. Client Involvement
3. Better Quality Assurance
Disadvantages of Agile

2. Requires Client Involvement
3. Documentation May Suffer
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Projects Where Agile is More Beneficial
1. Requirements are evolving or not fully defined at the start.
2. Frequent feedback from stakeholders or end-users is required.
3. The project environment is fast-paced or subject to rapid changes, such as technology advancements or market shifts.
4. The product can be delivered incrementally, allowing for early releases and continuous improvements
Examples of Agile Projects:
Mobile App Development: Features and user needs can change rapidly as feedback is gathered from early versions of the app. Agile allows developers to make iterative improvements based on user testing.
Projects Where Waterfall is More Beneficial:
1. Requirements are stable and unlikely to change.
2. There is a fixed budget and timeline, making predictability essential.
3. Stakeholders need to see a fully completed product at the end, with minimal room for changes during development.
4. The project is large, structured, and requires clear documentation for regulatory, legal, or safety reasons
Examples of Waterfall Projects:
Government Contracts: Many government projects require strict adherence to predefined requirements and timelines. Waterfall is often used because it allows for clear planning, detailed documentation, and minimizes the risk of scope changes.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
